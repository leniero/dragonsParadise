and once again you come to me and tell me about the open sea of the coasts of your homeland, about the
icy wind sweeping from the pole in winter, with neither bay, nor seagull nor albatross flying close to
the grey waters to dive, as it did once, somewhere, quickly snapping a fish up with its sharp beak, 
but these other waters that i remember were light green, the sun was there and i think that there
also was a silver spark on the bird’s beak at the precise moment of diving, in these waters which
you tell me about when you take me and carry me away to unending stories or walks, where there is
nor green nor light, the sun does not shine through the clouds, and then i imagine you standing alone
over the endless strip of sand, the wind that blows against your face, the hands with purple fingers
with cold deep in the pockets, the wind and the wind again that blows against your face, this same
face that looks at me now - seldom -, your eye meets my eye and soon turns away, as if in my pupils
there was a knife, a stone, a cutting edge, your face more unveiled than ever before, on the seashore,
with this wind hitting and making a mess of your hair and thoughts and me without knowing what is
messing me now when your eye once again drifts away far from my eye between your big forehead from
where sometimes you take your hair away with both hands, in a mixture of ostentatious laziness and
sensuality, and when your eye drifts like this, i do not know where to, perhaps to the same place
where you were yesterday, on the open seashore, where i do not penetrate, as i do not penetrate you now,
but it is when the stone or the knife in the bottom of my eye moves away from your eyes that i look
at you carefully, and you will never know how much and how i already know each millimetre of your skin,
these ever deep creases surrounding your eyebrows which rise suddenly to soon become diluted in
increasingly thinning hair, up to the spot where you often shave it careless, and i also know all your
stiff and secret stubble, hidden under your lower lip, slightly divided in the middle, and so slyly
i spy you and you never notice me that way, corrupting you as if through every lint, every pore,
i could reach that deeper part of you that you subtly hide from me, obstinate, through stories such
as this one, about the sea, the old aunts, the initiations, the exiles, the prisons, the scars,
and everything that you tell me while you are thinking, maybe, that this is your way to give yourself
to me, resentfully i notice that you hide even more, as if by telling me about yourself you denied
almost deliberately the possibility of discovering you behind and beyond everything that you tell me,
and that is why i hide myself from your stories that entangle me more and more in what is not you,
but what you were, i try to run away from you and each night, as a child fearing sins, punishments of
avenging angels with flaming swords, i promise myself not to hear you anymore, not to have you so
untruthfully close, and i escape abruptly so that you notice that i barely stand your presence,
poison poison, sometimes i say sour things and somehow i want you to understand that it is not like this,
that i increasingly fear what i have been feeling all these months, and it does not find any resolution,
but i come back and i always come back, and then you invade me again with this same game and although
i supposedly know the rules, i allow you to entirely take me with your strange liturgies, to condone
with your fears which i do not decipher, to accept them as a starving dog accepts a fleshless bone,
these crumbles that you keep throwing between the words and the empty plates, i come back again and again,
perhaps grieved over your eye which does not bend over another like it does over mine, fearing the knife,
the stone, the cutting edge of your long stories, of your sad memories, full of musty corridors, old maidens
locked in their bedrooms, open balconies over alleys where single girls dry their hair, showing their breasts,
i will always come back because i need this bone, these brans that have fed me all this time, and
i always cry when the days finish because i know that we won’t seek each other throughout the nights,
when the danger i feel increases and without self- control i would attack you like a hungry vampire
to take your blood and leave you speechless, without any story to hide you from me, while my teeth penetrating
the veins of your throat would extract from the bottom this life that you gently deny to me, every time you
look for me and take me, however i am even more poisoned when you do not come and then nobody sees me
standing still as an old man at twilight in august, darkened by your absence, and then i become even darker
and i enter so much into this darkness when you are in front of me and again you take me and you wrench me
from myself misleading me through these known paths where behind each word i try hopelessly to find a sense,
a code, any password that would allow me to expect a shortcut where you do not turn your eyes away suddenly,
where your finger does not caress my arm so briefly, where you remain longer around what i am and think maybe
that if i accept your schemes, and you throw up over me, afterwards you flush and go away, leaving me full of
the bitter waste that you did not digest, but even so you think that you could also accept my games, these which
i do not propose, oh scraps, but everything is useless and i know well how i have tried to feed myself with this
dirty husk which we call, in hunger and pity, glimmers of hope, while i waste away as an animal fed only with water,
thin and scant water, and not this dense thick and murky seawater which you told me about earlier in the afternoon
which is now slowly fading behind my back, and still here by your side, without you to see me, i slowly sharpen
the stones and the knives of the bottom of my pupils so that night does not come and find me awake again,
alone piecing together your features and your hair, one by one, so that when these dark eyes of yours,
still like the winter seawaters on the beach where perhaps you still walk, while i train myself in sharping edges,
glance once again on mine, their blade is so sharp that they can tear you down to the bottom, so you crawl on this
floor which we plant everyday with scrawled papers and cigarette butts, bleeding and groaning, begging of me
that same gesture you have never made, and i do not even know which gesture it would be, but that would wrench us
abruptly and definitely out of this gentile lie in which i do not know whether deliberately or casually we sink
little by little, drunk like flies on sugar, covered in molasses of our own cynical and cowardly sweetness,
contaminated by our false purity, soaked with words and literature, and would afterwards throw us completely naked,
with no story, with no word, onto this same seashore of the coasts of your homeland, and once more you come to me
and reach me and invade me and take me and ask me and lose me and spill yourself over me with your always
escaping eyes and open your mouth to release new stories and once again i feel myself complete, with no urgencies,
and i concentrate entirely on the things you tell me, and quiet like this, and submissive like this, i chew you
inside me while you stab me delicately slow making it clear in each promise that will never be fulfilled,
that i should not hope for anything beyond this coloured mask, that you want me in this way because this is
the way that you are and it is only in this way that you want me and you use me every day, and we use each other
honestly in this way, i hungrily digesting what your body rejects, drinking your magic and dirty poison which
enlightens me and nights me every day, and i sink step by step in this quagmire which i am not sure if
it is the great knowledge of ourselves or the immense deceit of you and me, we separate then cautiously at dusk,
and inside of each one’s loneliness i know we slowly weave our next lie, so well woven that on the following
morning it will be like pure truth and we will smile smoothly, turning our eyes away, ordinarily, as the day
advances it builds millimetre by millimetre a harmony which will only softly crumble when we rub fearfully our
eyes and our skins, the ice, the worms gnawing the vaults that we insist in leaving untouched, until which that
not done accumulated all this time grows as a cancerous cell to maybe explode in undisguisable visible wounds,
crazy red flowers on the skin surface which we refuse to touch out of disgust or cowardice or a passion so
devilish that it would not survive the holy water of its own baptism, and while you speak and twist and involve
and fascinate me with your monotonous and always low voice, with a strange foreign accent, i always think that
the sea is not this dense and dark one which you tell me about, without palm trees nor islands nor bays nor seagulls,
but another one lighter and greener, some place where it is always summer and emotions are as clean as the sands
we walk on, you do not know anything about my sea because i do not say anything, and i am afraid that it is again
that pious, hungry thing, the glimmer of a hope, but when i turn my eye from your eye, i always keep your face
inside me and i know that by choice or fatality, it does not matter, we are so entwined that it would be impossible
to step back to avoid going up to the end and to the bottom of this which i have never lived before and perhaps
i have just made up to pass the time these days when apparently nothing happens and have made up in you a toy
similar to mine so that the mornings and the afternoons do not pass so lonely searching for the reasons for the
fright and insomnia and the useless burning waiting and the crazy nocturnal inventions, and slowly you speak,
and slowly i shut up, and slowly i accept, and slowly i break, and slowly i fail, and slowly i fall deeper and deeper
and i cannot come up again because the hand that you reach out to me instead of pulling me out is in fact
pushing me in more and more while you say and tell and repeat these long stories, these sad stories, these crazy stories
like this one which would end here, now, this way, if you had not come once again and blinded me and drowned me
in this open sea which we know does not end nor like this nor now nor here .....................................
